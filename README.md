# workout-generator
A simple workout generator using command line, ruby, and SQLite


##Project Vision
This will be a small command line program that randomly generates a workout based upon the user input. A user can create either a swim, run, or bike workout and asign it an intensity of 1-5. The user can then generate a list of the possible workouts, and edit them. The user then asks the program for a workout and give the program an intensity.

#Features

##Create my Workouts
In order to keep all my workouts straight I want to create a workout and add it to my list. 

##Viewing the Workouts
I need to look over my workouts before choosing one, or to make an edit to my workout.

##Edit my existing Workouts
I am getting bored with my workout so I want to go in and edit my workouts to add new exercises to it. 

##Remove A Workout
I am over this workout becuase it's too hard on my knees so I want to remove it.  

##Ask for Workout
I can't decide which workout to do to, I want to be told what to do today.
